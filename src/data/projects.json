        "description": "Frames by Ashwin is my personal photography portfolio. I wanted a place on the web to show my photos; not just dump them somewhere, but actually curate and organize them. So I built my own app. It’s a simple idea: I can log in, upload images, create albums, and manage everything myself. Visitors get a clean gallery experience that works great on mobile and desktop. Behind the scenes, it’s all custom; just how I like it. This project let me combine two things I enjoy: building with code and capturing moments with a camera.",

So I built IDBFiles; a file manager that works entirely in your browser. You can upload, preview, and download files without ever hitting a server. It’s all local, persistent, and private. Everything runs client-side, and your files stick around until you decide to delete them or clear browser data.",
